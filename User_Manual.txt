Python v. 3.6.2

graphTSP User Manual:
1.To run the program, please run the file main.py through a terminal using python. 
2.The program will prompt for user input regarding the file to read. To test with sample input, enter: ./samp.txt
3.The terminal will then output the graph, the distance table, information on the graph, and the shortest distance through all checkpoints from S to G
4.The program will repeat from step 2, to exit, 



program listings:
main.py- runs a prompt for input to run the TSP through the Held-Karp algorithm
classes\nodes.py- creates a node object for use in reading the graph and running BFS

Method listings(further details in in-line documentation):
parseFileToArray- reads a file in as a 2d array of characters
parseArraytoNodeArr- changes an array of strs to an array of nodes
getFirstIndexOf- finds the index of the first node of type nodeType(parameter)
formDistTable- forms the distance table used for dynamic programming
formNeighbors- finds the distance of a node to all other nodes
TSP- sets up for the iterating of the DP table
tspIter- propogates values through a table to solve the minimal distance
TSPGraphDist- A function that takes a filename as input, and uses all aformented methods to calculate the solution
main- prompts for user input to run TSPGraphDist

Sample Outputs:
sampleOutput\output1- terminal output of the program run on ./samp.txt
